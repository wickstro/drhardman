                <h1>BENEFITS</h1>

                    <p>Renowned for its health benefits, shea butter has been used by Africans for thousands of years. It is different from other ingredients in cosmetic products in that it actually encourages your skin to absorb moisture from the air ensuring that your skin becomes softer and stays moisturised for longer. Regular users of Raw Organic Shea Butter notice they have softer, smoother, healthier skin.

                    <br>Raw Organic Shea Butter naturally contains vitamin A and E. Vitamin A is important for improving a number of skins conditions, including, blemishes, wrinkles, eczema and dermatitis. Vitamin E is a common anti-ageing ingredient that protects your skin.</p>

                    <h2>Where does Dr Hardman's Raw Organic Shea Butter come from?</h2>

                    <p>Shea butter comes from the Karite tree, also known as womens gold™. This tree grows in the Savannah regions of West Africa from Senegal in the west to Sudan in the east and onto the foothills of the Ethiopian highlands.</p>

                    <h2>What is Raw Shea Butter used for?</h2>

                    <p>Raw Shea Butter can be used to help ease a variety of skin conditions, including eczema, dermatitis, psoriasis, minor skin irritations, extreme dryness or toughness, stretch mark, burns, cuts and small skin wounds, sun burn, insect bites, ageing marks, fungal infections, scars, dandruff and many more.

                    <br>It can also help protect against extreme cold weather and even protect your muscles before and after strenuous exercise.</p>

                    <p>The shea butter used in Dr Hardman's products has received both Fairtrade certification (from the Fairtrade Foundation, UK) and organic status (from the Soil Association, UK) in 2009. The Fairtrade Raw Organic Shea Butter is 100% unrefined, as raw, natural and as beautiful as you can get it. It retains all its natural content (vitamins A, E, F, minerals, proteins and a fatty acid profile) to ensure that it is suitable for a variety of skin types and that it will help your skin retain its brilliance and elasticity.

                    <br>Other products on the market contain refined white shea butter. Refined shea butter has been stripped of its nourishing properties and supplemented with extra ingredients to replace those lost in the refining process.

                    <br>Be kind to your skin  and try the nourishing goodness of Dr Hardmans products with unrefined Fairtrade Raw Organic Shea Butter, for example:
