                <h1>ABOUT</h1>
                    <p>The cocoa butter used by Dr Hardman is made by pressing the whole bean thus retaining vital antioxidants. This coldpressing process uses only the heat from the friction caused when pressing the bean which helps protect the antioxidants.

                        <br>Cocoa beans Dr Hardman uses, are sourced from small-scale farmers in Uganda  mainly family units who farm a combination of cocoa, coffee and papaya.</p>
                <h1>BENEFITS</h1>
                <p>Cocoa butter makes an excellent skin moisturizer, plus it does more than just hydrate the skin — it helps actually heal it from the inside out too. It’s a great source of natural antioxidants that are found in cocoa beans (the same kinds found in real, dark chocolate that are tied to benefits like heart health and improved cognitive functioning). Saturated fats are especially beneficial for healing dry, cracked skin because they’re easily absorbed and remain on the skin for hours.</p>

                <p>Natural hydrating products also tend to cause much less irritation for people with sensitive skin while still locking in moisture, since they’re free from additives, fragrances, colors and dyes used in most commercial products.</p>

                <p>One of the most popular ways to use cocoa butter is on the lips. Cocoa butter is an emollient, which means it adds a protective layer of hydration to your lips, useful for blocking the effects of very cold temperatures, sun damage or indoor heat, which can leave your lips dry.</p>
