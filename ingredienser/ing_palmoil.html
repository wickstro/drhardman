                <h1>WHAT IS PALM OIL</h1>
                <p>Palm oil is extracted from two types of oil palm fruit: <em>Elaeis guineensis</em>, which is common in African regions, and <em>Elaeis oleifera</em>, whichis found in South America.<br>

                    Historical accounts suggest that palm oil was a part of the diet of indigenous populations. At present, it has become the second most traded oil crop in the world, after soy, with Malaysia and Indonesia as its main producers.<br>

                    Palm oil is not to be confused with palm kernel oil. Both are obtained from the fruit, but the latter is derived from the seeds of the oil palm. Palm kernel oil has a higher amount of saturated fat, which makes it ideal for cooking as well.</p>
                <h1>BENEFITS</h1>
                    <p>Palm oil — also known as red palm oil — contains high amounts of saturated fat, vitamins, and antioxidants. If you see palm oil that’s colorless (also known as white palm oil), it means that it has been processed. The lack of color means it has been stripped off most of its nutritional properties.</p>
                    <p>Palm oil can help strengthen immune function and promote skin health. As a fat-rich oil, palm oil helps provide energy and enhance the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients such as vitamins A, D, and E.
